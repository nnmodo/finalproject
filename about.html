        <h2>Our purpose.</h2>
        <p>We are all about giving you the help you need. Whether it's an item list, or advice. That's why we're here.
            I started this website because I too at one point didn't know a thing about camping. I struggled on my own unti I sought out the advice
            from others. My ultimate goal is to help those in need.</p>

        <p>I have lived in Georgia for a vast majority of my life. That being said it is the perfect state if you love camping. From the large quantity
            of dense forests to the North Georgia Mountains, it is ideal to try camping. This site is perfect for thos who have maybe just moved here
            or even those who are just visiting. Everyone needs advice. Even if they are already experienced.
